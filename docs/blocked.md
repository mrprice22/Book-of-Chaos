# Blocked — Autopilot Escalations

The autopilot writes here **instead of guessing** when it hits something only a human can
decide. Anything in this file is waiting on you.

Every entry must name the task, what was tried, and the specific decision needed. "It
didn't work" is not an entry.

## Template

```
### <task id> — <one-line summary>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Tried:** what was attempted, and what happened
**Blocker:** the specific thing that cannot be resolved without a human
**Options:** the candidate paths, with a recommendation
**Needs:** the exact decision or credential required
```

## What counts as blocked

- A credential, account, or paid service is required (hosting, domain, API key)
- Two reasonable implementations differ in a way the user would care about, and
  [mvp-scope.md](./mvp-scope.md) does not settle it
- A task appears to require something [mvp-scope.md](./mvp-scope.md) explicitly defers
- The same stage of `verify.sh` has failed three times with genuinely different fixes attempted
- An upstream dependency is broken, unavailable, or has no working version

## What does NOT count as blocked

- A test is failing and the fix is legible → fix it
- An implementation choice with an obvious default → take the default, note it in the commit
- A design-doc feature is ambiguous but out of MVP scope → it is deferred, move on
